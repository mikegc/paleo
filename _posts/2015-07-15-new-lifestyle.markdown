Both me and the wife have recently moved jobs to London and are now into our second week. Our daily routine currently consists of:

* 05:40 - Waking, quick breakfast, shower etc
* 06:30 - Walking for 06:51 train
* 08:00 - Start work.
* 09:00 - Snack or porridge.
* 11:00 - Snack, usually a naked bar or rice cake with nut butter or some fruit.
* 12:00 - Lunch.
* 16:00 - Home time!
* 18:00 - Back home, later if wondering around London, shopping.
* Time for cooking, preparing the next days food, exercise and TV.
* 22:00 - Bed

It certainly feels like a lot to fit in the evenings where i'd rather be relaxing than cooking! So how are we going about it?

#Two week food plan
We created a spreadsheet with a food plan of two weeks (excluding weekends as we like to find new recipes to try or out etc). The reason is is two weeks and not one is so we can batch cook, but keep a variety of food groups.

It's fine to go off plan, but it helps to know what we need to buy and when. It also gives us a fallback, so less worry what we are going to eat tonight, even if we change our minds, or life gets in the way. Obviously we keep it to a Fitter Food/paleo/high performance living style.

#High Performace Living (HPL)
My wife is recently enrolled in a course with a nutritionist from High Performance Living as she had plateaued in her fat loss, and wanted some custom advice. So far she has lost 2kg over about a week and a half which is fantastic, and is actually eating more! It just goes to show that a change in macro nutrients and a bit of help can give bit results.

#Just the beginning
This is just the beginning of our new lifestyle and we still have a lot to figure out in terms of work, exercise and life balance, but hopefully it will help you on your journey to a happier, awesome and fitter you!
