Strong Paleo has been created by Mike and Kristine Currie, as somewhere for us to share our experiences of becoming fitter, stronger and healthier people and hopefully help you.

We met each other at University through the ice hockey team, which Mike helped to found, and later got married. We both strive to improve ourselves and have gone through a number of diets/fads to try and help. Eventually we came across the Paleo-ish "diet" from [Fitter Foods](http://store.fitterlondon.co.uk/fitter-food-a-lifelong-recipe-for-health-fat-loss-2nd-edition/), which made a lot of sense to us, eating fantastic tasting, nutrient dense food which can be cooked quickly. In essence, Paleo is the avoidance of sugar, processed foods and grains.

Nutrition is difficult! What works for one person doesn't always work for someone else, add on to that different goals, health, fitness, time, gut and mental issues just to name a few. However, by making small, incremental changes at your own pace, you can make a significant difference. Hopefully our blog and receipes will help give you some new ideas.

#General nutritional reading

If this is all new to you, we recommend reading up about Paleo from people much more knowledgeable than us.
